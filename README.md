# Mid term (Hands-on)

## Question 1

Write and test a Java/Python recursive method for counting the occurrences of a specific element in an array, A, of n elements. What is the running time? Hint: The base case is an array of size 0, and the recursive case involves checking the first element and then counting occurrences in the remaining array.

## Question 2

Write and test an efficient Java/Python method for splitting a Singlylinked list L into two separate Singly linked lists, each containing half of the elements (if L has an odd number of elements, one list should have one more element than the other). Hint: Add the method to the SinglyLinkedList class and ensure the method runs in linear time.

## Exercise 3

Let B be an array of size n ≥ 6 containing integers from 1 to n−5 inclusive, five of which are repeated. Write and test a method for finding the five integers in B that are repeated. What is the running time of this algorithm? Hint: Sort the array B then scan it from front to end looking for the repeated entries
